GemEdit is lowkey tryna cook up a full-featured, browser-based motion graphics and video editing tool. Think of it as **Adobe After Effects**, but running straight outta your web browser, deployed on Vercel, and built by us. No massive downloads, just vibes.

We’re focused on providing a fluid, professional editing experience for quick compositions and viral-ready content, backed by robust database persistence.

## Key Features (It Slaps)
* **Timeline Editor:** Frame-by-frame layer control with a focus on ease-of-use.
* **Masking & Transforms:** Intuitive UI for manipulating position, scale, and rotation.
* **Velocity Graphs:** Custom keyframe interpolation using advanced curve math for buttery-smooth animations.
* **Asset Management:** Secure file upload and storage handled by Supabase Storage.
* **Code Effects:** The ability to import custom JavaScript for next-level visual effects (sandboxed for safety, fr).

## The Stack (How We're Cooking)
This is a lightweight, high-performance web app relying on external services for a seamless developer experience:

* **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (`main.js`, `index.html`)
* **Data Persistence & Storage:** **Supabase** (PostgreSQL Database, Auth, and Storage)
* **Deployment:** Vercel + GitHub combo

## Status
We're currently setting up the core UI components and securing the database connection. Pull requests are welcome if you wanna help us get this bread.
